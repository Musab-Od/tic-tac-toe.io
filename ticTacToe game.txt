ticTacToe game

first we need to create the board of the game 3x3;

we need an array and each element should have a unique square on the ui

after making it we need the players where each player has a name and a mark

then the rules:
gameStart: one of the player should mark a square then switch turn

win condition: 3-in-a-row row/columns/diagonal and if this does not happen then it's a tie
when game ends we have option to restart the game

first we need a place to select the players/bots before start, then the game board should ne rendered, then winning/losing/tie message and restart action.

handleclicks = first player mark will fill the index of the gamboard selected and then the ui will change and get x on the screen + when hovering on the cell will get a mark shadow
after that will switch turns and player two mark will be hit the gamboard **
